I'm so sorry to hear that you're dealing with a hernia. I want to help you feel more comfortable, but I also want to make sure you get the best advice possible. 

Before we discuss any medication, I want to emphasize that it's essential to consult a qualified doctor for personalized guidance. They can assess your specific situation and provide recommendations tailored to your needs.

That being said, I can offer some general information. For hernia symptoms, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) might help manage discomfort. However, it's crucial to follow the recommended dosage and consult your doctor before taking any medication, especially if you have other health conditions or take prescription medications.

It's also important to note that while medication can help with symptoms, it's not a substitute for proper medical evaluation and treatment. In many cases, hernias may require surgical intervention to repair.

I would strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a specialist, such as a general surgeon, to discuss your options and create a plan that's right for you.

Remember, I'm here to support you with general information, but it's essential to speak with a qualified doctor for personalized advice on managing your hernia.
